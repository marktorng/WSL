# Windows 10 Installation Guide

## Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux

Before installing any Linux distros for WSL, you must ensure that the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature is enabled:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
    ``` PowerShell
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
    ```

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

## Install your Linux Distribution of Choice
To download and install your preferred distro(s), you have three choices:
1. Download and install from the Microsoft Store (see below)
1. Download and install from the Command-Line/Script ([read the manual installation instructions](install-manual.md))
1. Download and manually unpack and install (for Windows Server - [instructions here](install-on-server.md))

### Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later: Install from the Microsoft Store

## Complete initialization of your distro
Now that your Linux distro is installed, you must [initialize your new distro instance](initialize-distro.md) once, before it can be used.

## Troubleshooting: 

Below are related errors and suggested fixes. Refer to the [WSL troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.md) for other common errors and their solutions.

* **Installation failed with error 0x80070003**
    * The Windows Subsystem for Linux only runs on your system drive (usually this is your `C:` drive). Make sure that distros are stored on your system drive:  
    * Open **Settings** -> **Storage** -> **More Storage Settings: Change where new content is saved**
